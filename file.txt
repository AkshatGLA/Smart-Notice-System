Dear Students,

This is to inform you that project topics have been assigned along with
designated mentors, and these problem statements *will not* be changed *under
any circumstances*. The synopsis format is provided, along with the
evaluation scheme; it must be followed exactly.

Your *first presentation round will take place on 14th February, 2025*. All
teams are hereby *strictly warned* that they must meet with their assigned
mentors *weekly*. A weekly progress report—*signed by the mentor*—is
mandatory. *Failure to meet* with the mentor or submit a signed progress
report *will result in an immediate mark of zero* for that week, and
repeated non-compliance will lead to *failure of the semester-project* and
subsequent carryover.

Please note that *no excuses* will be entertained. This is a *serious
departmental directive*: any student or team that neglects these
requirements will face *strict academic penalties*. Ensure *all* team
members are present for weekly meetings.

Prepare your synopsis and get it signed by your mentor for the
presentation. You are expected to *comply* fully with these instructions.

*No exceptions* will be made.
